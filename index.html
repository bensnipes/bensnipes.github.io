            <p>
                I am an engineering graduate with an interest in neural networks, natural language processing and computer vision. I love to be part of projects right from 
                the research stage through to deployment in production. My recent work focuses on designing, training  and integrating recommender systems in web and 
                mobile applications. I am open to working with companies and individuals whose objectives align with my interests.
                

            </p>
            
            <br>

            <p>            

                Not long ago, I helped design and train a neural network to detect plasmodium parasites in blood stains. The aim of the project was to help laboratory technicians
                easily determine the count of malaria parasites in blood smears.  This would provide an objective perspective during the parasite counting which otherwise would be 
                prone to human errors. 
                
            </p>

            <br>
            

            <p>            

                In my previous jobs, I worked as a geospatial data analyst at a drone survey company and also as a planning engineer at a mining company.

            </p>




            <p>
               I look forward to applying ai and machine learning to solving many real world problems.

            </p>
            
            <br>

            <p>            

                In my free time, I like to go out with friends, watch movies and have fun.
            </p>

                            This prototype is an application that has been integrated with a natural 
                            language processing system capable of analyzing texts to determine its 
                            suitability for readers(young, adults, middle-aged).<br> <br> The analyzer gives 
                            readability index, the age range, Grade and other statistics such as count
                            of profane words, word count, and others.<br> <br> It also has a recommender system 
                            embedded to help the reader find similar texts to the one being analysed. The 
                            project is currently on hold and I hope to work on it soon. This project is being worked on with

                            between any two stations. I embedded an extra functionality that makes the
